# Life-Expectencey
 Python and ML Project

Description:

This project focuses on utilizing data mining techniques to predict life expectancy and analyze health trends based on various environmental, social, and economic factors. As the world faces challenges with decreasing life expectancy rates and emerging diseases, it's crucial to understand the underlying factors contributing to these trends.

Problem Setting:

The project addresses the decline in life expectancy and increasing health challenges by examining a dataset sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO). This dataset encompasses a wide range of variables related to immunization, mortality, economic factors, and social indicators, which are essential for predicting life expectancy.

Data Exploration:

Utilized visualizations such as pair plots, box plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and heat maps to explore relationships between different variables and identify trends.
Removed outliers from the dataset to ensure data quality and reliability.
Data Mining Tasks:

Detected outliers using box plots and handled missing values by imputing means based on different countries.
Standardized the data to ensure fair comparison across different variables and applied dimension reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
Data Mining Models:

Employed various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, K Nearest Neighbor Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, ADA Boosting Regression, and Extra Tree Regression.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score.
Performance Evaluation:

Compared performance metrics of different regression models to identify the best-performing model.
Extra Tree Regression emerged as the top performer based on lower MSE, RMSE, Absolute Error, MAE, and higher R2 Score compared to other models.
Project Results:

Extra Tree Regression exhibited the best performance among all models, indicating its efficacy in predicting life expectancy based on the provided dataset.
The project underscores the significance of multiple factors influencing life expectancy and health outcomes, highlighting the potential for interventions to improve these metrics.
Impact of the Project Outcomes:

Analyzing the data enables the identification of regions or populations where interventions could lead to increased life expectancy.
Tracking changes in life expectancy over time facilitates the assessment of project impacts, such as improvements in access to clean water or healthcare services.
Using datasets like the WHO life expectancy data set aids in identifying areas for targeted interventions and measuring project success.
Future Directions:

Future iterations of the project could explore more complex models, including deep learning approaches, to further enhance prediction accuracy while guarding against overfitting. Continual updates and refinement of the analysis could provide insights into evolving health trends and guide proactive measures to address emerging challenges.
